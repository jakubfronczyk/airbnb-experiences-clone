#  AirBnb Experiences Clone using React

### In this project i have learned:
* Using props
* Destructuring props
* Passing string and non-string props to
* React render array
* Mapping components
* Loading images from `.map()`
* Spread objects as props

The most important thing to me was mapping over data that means if data ever changes my page automatically will update in card section where you can see Online Experiences
